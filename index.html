		<p> <span>Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac's</span>  father was <span>Charles Adrien Ladislas Dirac</span> and his mother was 
			<span>Florence Hannah Holten</span>. Charles Dirac was a Swiss citizen born in Monthey, in the Valais Canton of Switzerland, 
			while his mother came from Cornwall in England. Charles had been educated at the University of Geneva, then came to England 
			in around 1888 and taught French in Bristol. 
	
		There he met Florence, whose father had moved to Bristol as Master Mariner on a Bristol ship, when she was working in the library there. 
		Charles and Florence married in 1899 and they moved into a house in Bishopston, Bristol, which they named Monthey after the town of Charles's
		birth. By this time Charles was teaching French at the secondary school attached to the Merchant Venturers Technical College in Bristol.
		
		
		
		Paul was one of three children, his older brother being Reginald Charles Felix Dirac and his younger sister being 
		Beatrice Isabelle Marguerite Walla Dirac. Paul had a very strict family upbringing. His father insisted that only French be spoken at 
		the dinner table and, as a result, Paul was the only one to eat with his father in the dining room. Paul's father was so strict with 
		his sons that both were alienated and Paul was brought up in a somewhat unhappy home. </p>
		
		<blockquote>Paul's father was so strict with 
		his sons that both were alienated and Paul was brought up in a somewhat unhappy home.</blockquote>
		
		<p>He completed his school education in 1918 and then studied <span>electrical engineering</span> at <span>the University of Bristol</span>.
		 Although mathematics was his favourite subject he chose to study an engineering course at university since he thought that the only possible
		 career for a mathematician was school teaching and he certainly wanted to avoid that profession. He obtained his degree in engineering 
		 in 1921 but following this, after an undistinguished summer job in an engineering works, he did not find a permanent position. 
		 By this time he was developing a real passion for mathematics but his attempts to study at Cambridge failed for rather strange reasons.</p>
		<p>Taking the Cambridge scholarship examinations in June 1921 he was awarded a scholarship to study mathematics at St John's College, 
		Cambridge, but it did not provide enough to support him. Additional support would have been expected from his local education authority, 
		but he was refused support on the grounds that his father had not been a British citizen for long enough. Dirac was offered the chance 
		to study mathematics at Bristol without paying fees and he did so being awarded first class honours in 1923. Following this he was 
		awarded a grant to undertake research at Cambridge and he began his studies there in 1923. </p>
		
		<p>He made an excellent start to his research career, even more impressive work was to follow. This was as a result of Dirac being given 
		proofs of a paper by <span>Heisenberg</span> to read in the summer of 1925. The significance of the algebraic properties of Heisenberg's 
		commutators struck Dirac when he was out for a walk in the country. He realised that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle was a statement 
		of the noncommutativity of the quantum mechanical observables. He realised the analogy with Poisson brackets in Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>
		
		<p>The ideas were laid out in Dirac's doctoral thesis Quantum mechanics for which he was awarded a Ph.D. in 1926. It is remarkable that 
		Dirac had eleven papers in print before submitting his doctoral dissertation. Following the award of the degree he went to Copenhagen 
		to work with <span>Niels Bohr</span>, moving on to Göttingen in February 1927 where he interacted with <span>Robert Oppenheimer</span>, 
		<span>Max Born</span>, <span>James Franck</span> and the Russian <span>Igor Tamm</span>. Accepting an invitation from <span>Ehrenfest</span>, 
		he spent a few weeks in Leiden on his way back to Cambridge. He was elected a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge in 1927. </p>
		<p>In 1930 Dirac published The principles of <span>Quantum Mechanics</span> and for this work he was awarded the 
		<span>Nobel Prize for Physics</span> in 1933.</p>
		
		<blockquote>The Nobel Prize in Physics 1933 was awarded jointly to Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac 
		"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory." </blockquote>
		<p> In 1930 Dirac was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Dirac was appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics at the 
		University of Cambridge in 1932, a post he held for 37 years. He was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1939 
		and the Society awarded him their Copley Medal in 1952  </p>
		
		<p>In 1969 Dirac retired from the Lucasian chair of mathematics at Cambridge and went with his family to <span>Florida in the United States</span>.
		He held visiting appointments at the University of Miami and at Florida State University. Then, in 1971, Dirac was appointed professor of 
		physics at <span>Florida State University</span> where he continued his research. </p>
		
		<p> Dirac received many honours for his work, some of which we have mentioned above. He refused to accept honorary degrees but he 
		did accept honorary membership of academies and learned societies. The list of these is long but among them are <span>USSR Academy of 
		Sciences (1931)</span>, <span>Indian Academy of Sciences (1939)</span>, <span>Chinese Physical Society (1943)</span>, 
		<span>Royal Irish Academy (1944)</span>, <span>Royal Society of Edinburgh (1946)</span>, <span>Institut de France (1946)</span>, 
		<span>National Institute of Sciences of India (1947)</span>, <span>American Physical Society (1948)</span>, 
		<span>National Academy of Sciences (1949)</span>, <span>National Academy of Arts and Sciences (1950)</span>, 
		<span>Accademia delle Scienze di Torino (1951)</span>, <span>Academia das Ciencias de Lisboa (1953)</span>, 
		<span>Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Vatican City (1958)</span>, <span>Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Rome (1960)</span>, 
		<span>Royal Danish Academy of Sciences (1962)</span>, and <span>Académie des Sciences Paris (1963)</span>. He was appointed to the <span>Order of Merit</span> 
		in 1973. </p>

		<p>In 1984, Dirac died in Tallahassee, Florida, and was buried at Tallahassee's Roselawn Cemetery. Dirac's childhood home in 
			Bishopston, Bristol is commemorated with a blue plaque, and the nearby Dirac Road is named in recognition of his 
			links with the city of Bristol. A commemorative stone was erected in a garden in Saint-Maurice, Switzerland, 
			the town of origin of his father's family, on 1 August 1991. On 13 November 1995 a commemorative marker, made from 
			Burlington green slate and inscribed with the Dirac equation, was unveiled in Westminster Abbey. The Dean of Westminster, 
			Edward Carpenter, had initially refused permission for the memorial, thinking Dirac to be anti-Christian, but was eventually 
			(over a five-year period) persuaded to relent.</p>

		<h2>Quotes</h2>
			<blockquote>
				I think that there is a moral to this story, namely that it is more important to have beauty in one's equations 
				that to have them fit experiment. If Schrödinger had been more confident of his work, he could have published it 
				some months earlier, and he could have published a more accurate equation. It seems that if one is working from the 
				point of view of getting beauty in one's equations, and if one has really a sound insight, one is on a sure line of 
				progress. If there is not complete agreement between the results of one's work and experiment, one should not allow 
				oneself to be too discouraged, because the discrepancy may well be due to minor features that are not properly taken 
				into account and that will get cleared up with further development of the theory.

		<h2>Quotes about Dirac</h2>

		<blockquote>
			Perhaps the most distinguished of 'why botherers has been Dirac (1963 Sci. American 208 May 45). 
			He divided the difficulties of quantum mechanics into two classes, those of the first class and 
			those of the second. The second-class difficulties were essentially the infinities of relativistic 
			quantum field theory. Dirac was very disturbed by these, and was not impressed by the 'renormalisation'
			procedures by which they are circumvented. Dirac tried hard to eliminate these second-class difficulties,
			 and urged others to do likewise. The first-class difficulties concerned the role of the 'observer', 
			 'measurement', and so on. Dirac thought that these problems were not ripe for solution, and should be 
			 left for later. He expected developments in the theory which would make these problems look quite 
			 different. It would be a waste of effort to worry overmuch about them now, especially since we get 
			 along very well in practice without solving them.
		</blockquote>
		<p class="span2"> - <span>John S. Bell</span>, "Against 'mesurement'", Physics World (August 1990)</p>

		<blockquote>
			Dirac was the strangest man who ever visited my institute. […] During one of Dirac’s visits 
			I asked him what he was doing. He replied that he was trying to take the square-root of a matrix, 
			and I thought to myself what a strange thing for such a brilliant man to be doing. Not long afterwards
			 the proof sheets of his article on the equation arrived, and I saw he had not even told me that 
			 he had been trying to take the square root of the unit matrix! 
		</blockquote>
		<p class="span2"> - <span>Niels Bohr</span>, quoted in Kurt Gottfried, "P.A.M. Dirac and the Discovery of 
			Quantum Mechanics" (2010)</p>

			<blockquote>
				I have trouble with Dirac. This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful. 
			</blockquote>
			<p class="span2"> - <span>Albert Einstein</span>, in James Clerk Maxwell (1931), p. 72-73</p>

			<blockquote>
				There is no God and Dirac is his Prophet.
			</blockquote>
